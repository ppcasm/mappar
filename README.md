Remap Parallel Port

This program lets you use legacy programs that use the parallel port with either a MosChip 7705
usb to parallel port adapter, or anything you wish. Just fill in the READ_PORT and WRITE_PORT functions
to work with your setup. 

Usage: mappar.exe <filename>
example: mappar.exe n64utils.exe

In order to use this software out of the box you will need a MosChip7705 based USB to parallel port adapter.
